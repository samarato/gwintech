## Facebook Ads Marketing Rules

When I ask you to create Facebook ads, follow these expert rules:

### Ad Copy Formulas (Use These)

**1. PAS (Problem - Agitation - Solution)** — Highest converting
```
[Problem] State the pain point directly
[Agitation] Make them feel the cost of inaction
[Solution] Present Gwin Tech as the answer + CTA
```

**2. BAB (Before - After - Bridge)**
```
[Before] Describe their current frustrating situation
[After] Paint the picture of the ideal outcome
[Bridge] Show how Gwin Tech makes it happen + CTA
```

**3. AIDA (Attention - Interest - Desire - Action)**
```
[Attention] Hook with a surprising stat or bold statement
[Interest] Relate to their business needs
[Desire] Show proof and results
[Action] Clear CTA with low friction
```

**4. FAB (Feature - Advantage - Benefit)**
```
[Feature] What we offer technically
[Advantage] Why it's better than alternatives
[Benefit] How it impacts their business bottom line
```

### Facebook Ad Rules
1. **Lead with pain points, not technology** — "Struggling with disconnected systems?" beats "We use React and Node.js"
2. **First line must stop the scroll** — Use questions, stats, or bold statements
3. **Keep primary text under 125 characters** above the fold on mobile
4. **Use specific numbers** — "150+ projects delivered" not "many projects"
5. **Always include low-friction CTA** — "Free consultation," "Free project assessment," "Get a quote in 24 hours"
6. **Pain-point messaging outperforms benefit messaging by 41%** in conversion rate
7. **Refresh creatives 2-4 times per month** to avoid ad fatigue
8. **Always A/B test** video vs. carousel vs. static — expect 25-60% difference in CPL

### Target Audience for Facebook Ads

**Primary Targeting (Decision Makers):**
- Job titles: CEO, CTO, CIO, IT Director, IT Manager, Head of Digital, Product Manager, Operations Director

### Campaign Structure

- **Carousel:** 3-5 cards, each showing a different service or pain point
- **Static Image:** Clean design, one clear message, large text overlay
- **Lead Forms:** Use instant forms for 62% lower CPL; test vs. landing page

### Common Pain Points to Address in Ads
1. "We're drowning in manual processes"

3. "Off-the-shelf software doesn't fit our workflow"
4. "We can't scale with our current technology"

10. "We need to modernize but can't afford downtime"

### Budget & Bidding Guidelines
- Start with 500-1,000 THB/day per ad set
- Use Cost Cap bidding for stable CPL
- Campaign Budget Optimization (CBO) for 2-5 proven ad sets
- Allow 4-8 weeks for learning phase
- Never scale a losing campaign

### Tracking Requirements

- Conversions API (CAPI) for server-side tracking
- Custom conversions: "Schedule Demo," "Request Consultation," "Submit Form"
- Connect CRM for closed-loop attribution

## Landing Page Rules

### For Facebook Ad Traffic
1. Landing page headline MUST match the ad's promise
2. Lead capture form must be above the fold
3. Include trust badges: NDA Protected, Free Consultation, 24hr Response
4. Mobile-first design (90%+ of FB traffic is mobile)
5. Page load time < 3 seconds
6. One primary CTA per section
7. Real testimonials with names and companies

### CTA Text (High Converting)
- "Get Your Free Project Assessment" (best for software development)
- "Get a Custom Quote in 24 Hours"
- "Talk to Our Team Today"
- "Schedule Free Consultation"
- Avoid generic: "Submit," "Learn More," "Get Started"
